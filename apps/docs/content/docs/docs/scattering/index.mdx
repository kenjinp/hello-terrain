# Scattering

Welcome to the Scattering documentation. This section covers techniques for distributing objects, vegetation, and other elements across terrain surfaces.

## Overview

Scattering systems allow you to populate your terrain with various objects like trees, rocks, grass, and other environmental elements. Our scattering system provides efficient distribution algorithms with natural-looking results.

## Key Features

- **Rule-Based Distribution**: Define scattering rules based on height, slope, and other terrain parameters
- **Density Control**: Adjust object density across different terrain regions
- **Variation System**: Automatic variation in object placement, rotation, and scale
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for large-scale scattering
- **LOD Support**: Level-of-detail management for scattered objects
- **Collision Avoidance**: Prevent overlapping of scattered objects
