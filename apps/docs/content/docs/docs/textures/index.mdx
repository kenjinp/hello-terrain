# Textures

Welcome to the Textures documentation. This section covers texture generation, management, and optimization techniques for terrain rendering.

## Overview

Textures are essential components in terrain rendering that provide visual detail and realism to your landscapes. Our texture system supports various generation methods and optimization techniques.

## Key Features

- **Procedural Texture Generation**: Create textures algorithmically based on terrain parameters
- **Texture Blending**: Seamlessly blend multiple textures based on height, slope, and other factors
- **Mipmap Management**: Automatic mipmap generation for optimal performance
- **Texture Compression**: Support for various compression formats
- **UV Coordinate Generation**: Automatic UV mapping for terrain meshes
