# Procedural Generation

Welcome to the Procedural Generation documentation. This section covers algorithms and techniques for generating terrain procedurally using noise functions and mathematical approaches.

## Overview

Procedural generation allows you to create vast, diverse landscapes using mathematical algorithms and noise functions. Our system provides a comprehensive suite of generation tools for creating realistic and varied terrain.

## Key Features

- **Noise Algorithms**: Multiple noise types including Perlin, Simplex, and Worley noise
- **Multi-Octave Generation**: Layered noise for realistic terrain features
- **Erosion Simulation**: Realistic erosion patterns and water flow
- **Biome Generation**: Automatic biome assignment based on climate parameters
- **Seamless Generation**: Infinite terrain generation with consistent features
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune generation parameters for desired results
